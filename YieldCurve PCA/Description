Demonstrating how all possible yield curves can be estimated through an LC of 5 principal components.
loadvecs.pdf plot 3 principal components
3-PCs.pdf and 5-PC.pdf show how 3 or 5 principal components estimate the yield Curves
ExpVar.pdf shows the increase in expalined variance as a function of PCs
