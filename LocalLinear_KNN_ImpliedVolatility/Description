Attempt performing the prediction of the implied volatility for options that were not traded previously by using the informationprovided by previous trades.
Both pdfs show predicted implied volatility as function of Time to maturity and strike price
LLPreds.pdf uses Local Linear Regression for different Covariance Matrices
KNNPreds.pdf uses KNN for different values of K
